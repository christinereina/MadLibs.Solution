Hello, my name is astronaut @Name. I am on my way to @Spaceplace. 
I will be gone for @Number days. I feel very @Emotion about my trip to @Spaceplace.
I will miss @Miss1 and @Miss2 but I look forward to seeing @SpaceAttraction in outerspace.
Last time I flew my @Color rocket to @Spaceplace2 and when I got there, there was a giant family of @Bignumber @Animalplural
Luckily, I had a @Thing in my pocket. Space @Animalplural LOVE @Thing. I escaped safely and returned to my home planet @HomePlanet.
